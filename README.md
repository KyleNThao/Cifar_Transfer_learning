# About
Utilizing the image set Cifar-10, a model is trained on image processing for classification. This model is then compared to the pre-built model "VGG16" using transfer learning. 

# Viewing
This project was done in Python notebook and can be viewed alternatively in Jupyter's nbviewer for the best results.
